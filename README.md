This project is a collection of small tools I'm working on to better my own knowledge of pentesting/network principles
Feel free to use them as you see fit, they're far from perfect. Will update them as time goes on. 
You can find all the requirements in the requirements.txt, and those can all be installed using pip. 
If netifaces is throwing weird errors when installing, make sure you have C++ tools/compiler installed.
