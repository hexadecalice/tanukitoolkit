#This is still very much in its infancy, a lot more is to come.
#Currently, you need to have IP forwarding on for this to work.
#If you don't turn on IP forwarding, it'll still kind of work. You'll still successfully poison the ARP tables
#It's just...you won't be sending any of that info along to where it goes. So you're essentially cutting the internet off of whatever target you select.
